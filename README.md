# AVRTray

A basic Windows Forms .NET Core application for controlling any Marantz / Denon AVR that supports telnet commands

I made this because I can never find the remote while at my desk, and the AVR is often physically blocked by a door.

I'd use the Marantz HTTP-based web interface that was built into the AVR if they hadn't removed it for no reason.
